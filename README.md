# flutter-dart-training

* dart is type safe
* dynamic types are allowed
* pub.dev is the open source dart package manager
* following this course https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#1

* pubspec.yaml is the config for flutter apps and environments
* flutter run, press R in CLI for hot-reload (though I was hoping this was automatic?)
    * when running using vscode 'run + debug' option, hot-reload is actually hot (changes are applied once saved)
* all prints are sent to debug console logs
